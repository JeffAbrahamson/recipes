\begin{ingredients}
  \ingr{3}{lbs}{red potatoes}
  \ingr{1}{}{large white onion, diced}
  \ingr{2}{}{cloves garlic}
  \ingr{}{}{sea salt}
  \ingr{}{}{red pepper flakes}
  \ingr{2}{Tbsp}{oil}
  \ingr{2--3}{Tbsp}{mayonnaise}
  \ingr{pinch}{}{dried coriander}
  \ingr{pinch}{}{dried mustard}
\end{ingredients}


\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Boil potatoes whole and unpeeled until cooked, approximately
    30 minutes.  Place in cold water, drain, and cool.

  \item Saute onions, garlic, salt, and pepper flakes in oil for 3--4
    minutes.  Set aside.

  \item Cut potatoes into quarteres.  Place in a large bowl and mix
    with onion mixture.  Add coriander and mustard and an extra pinch
    of salt, mixing well.  Add mayonnaise and mix well.

  \item Refrigerate at least two hours before serving.

  \end{enumerate}
\end{recipe}

Note: I find this even better when served warm right after making it.
