Mincemeat  (fruity vegetarian version)

500g dried fruit: sultanas, raisins, currants, dried apricots, stoned
prunes, peaches ( not too many as very strong taste), pears, dates, figs
( can be bit gritty so I tend not too use) sour cherries, cranberries.
For larger pieces chop with scissors to about raisin size. At least half
the fruit should be sultanas/rasins/currants then whatever else you like

300ml liquid: juice of 1 orange and 1 lemon, strong cold tea, brandy
(proportions dependent upon taste, more brandy will allow it to keep
longer)

1 tablespoon spices  - mixed / cinamon / ground cloves

Soak fruit in liquid for at least 24 hours ( should have absorbed all
the liquid and be quite syrupy) then add 1 grated Cox apple, 1 finely
grated carrot and the zest of 1 orange and 1 lemon (organic and unwaxed)

mix well and pack into clean jar or plastic storage container, leave for
at least a couple days before use. If brandy content is low then keep in
the fridge.

Mince Pies (~24):

500g plain flour
300g butter
100g sugar
zest of 1 orange
1 egg yolk
juice of 1 orange

Sift flour, mix in sugar then rub in butter to fine breadcrumbs
Mix in zest then egg yolk
gradually add juice whilst mixing until pastry comes together into a
ball
rest in fridge for 1 hour before use (if leave longer it will go solid
and need bringing to room temperature before use)

We put 1 heaped teaspoon mincemeat and a tiny bit of cream cheese in
each pie
Cut a small shape or slit in the tops to let steam out
Cook at 180 for 20 min until firm but not too crisp
Cool then dust with icing sugar
