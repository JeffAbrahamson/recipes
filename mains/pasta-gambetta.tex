\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Thinly cut onions longitudinally and cook in a skillet with
    enough butter that they caramelise.  (Reduce the heat as they
    caramelise to avoid burning them.)

  \item While the onions cook, combine flour and water and mix to make
    pasta dough.  Let rest.

  \item Roll the pasta and cut as linguini.

  \item When the onions are well reduced, crush garlic and add to the
    onions, cooking a bit longer.

  \item Chop mozzarella.  Chop basil.

  \item Bring a large pot of water to boil.  Add pasta.  Drain.

  \item Combine onions, mozzarella, and pasta.  Toss.  Sprinkle basil
    on top and serve immediately.
