\begin{ingredients}
  \ingr{6}{Tbsp}{olive oil}
  \ingr{4}{c}{chopped onion}
  \ingr{7--8}{c}{packed mixed bitter greens, chopped coursely}
  \ingr{}{}{salt}
  \ingr{}{}{short, substantial pasta}
  \ingr{\fracH--\fracQQ}{lb}{feta cheese}
  \ingr{}{}{Parmesan}
  \ingr{}{}{ground black pepper}
\end{ingredients}


\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item In deep skillet or Dutch oven heat oil.  Add the onions and
    cook for about 10 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally.

  \item Add chopped greens, salt lightly, and stir until the greens
    begin to wilt.  Cover and cook 10--15 minutes over medium-low
    heat.  (Put water on to boil for pasta.)

  \item Cook the pasta.  As it becomes ready, add the crumbled feta
    cheese to the sauce, keeping the heat on low.

  \item Drain pasta and add directly to the sauce.  Mix thoroughly.

  \item Cook the completed dish slightly for a few minutes.

  \item Serve immediately on warmed plates, with a sprinkle of
    Parmesan and black pepper.

  \end{enumerate}

  Any combination of bitter greens works fine: kale, mustard, collard,
  dandelion, escarole, chard, spinach, etc.

  The dish works well with bite-size pasta, such as linguine cut to
  10~cm or so.
