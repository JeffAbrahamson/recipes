  \item Combine flour and water and mix to form a ball for the pasta.  Set aside to rest.

  \item Crush garlic cloves into a large bowl.  Add oil and mix.
    Coursely chop tomatoes, burrata, and basil, adding to the garlic
    bowl.  Add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.  Note that the
    cream in the burrata will give the mixture a creamy feel once tossed.

  \item Set a large pot of salted water to boil.

    roller), cut as spaghetti in 10--15~cm strands.  Drop into boiling

    and serve immediately.
