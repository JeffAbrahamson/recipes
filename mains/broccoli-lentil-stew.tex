\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Cook the lentils.

  \item While the lentils are cooking, coarsely chop the onion and
    saut\'e in olive oil.  The idea for the onion and all the other
    chopped vegetables in this dish is to keep them large enough to be
    recognizable at the end and to give the dish interesting texture
    but small enough to be bite sized.

  \item When the onions are starting to become translucent, add garlic.

  \item Chop broccoli and add to onion and garlic.  Add peppers and
    any other vegetables desired.  Add tomatoes last when the other
    vegetables are at least limp.

  \item Season to taste and simmer 15--30 minutes.  Add lentils.

  \end{enumerate}
