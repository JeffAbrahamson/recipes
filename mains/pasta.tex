\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Mix, form a ball, and let sit 10--15 minutes.  The dough may
    be wrapped well (e.g., in plastic wrap) and refrigerated if it
    won't be used immediately after the short rest.

  \item Roll to a thin strip so that it can pass through the pasta
    rollers.

  \item Form noodles and cut.  At this point, but not before, it may
    be allowed to dry.  If the noodles will not be dropped immediately
    in boiling water, dust with flour before cutting to avoid their
    sticking together.

  \item Cook in salted boiling water until \textit{al dente},
    typically a few minutes, depending on pasta thickness.

  \end{enumerate}
