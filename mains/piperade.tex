\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item In a large, heavy saut\'e pan or skillet over medium-low heat,
  saut\'e the onions in the olive oil until they begin to soften,
  about 10 to 15 minutes.  Sprinkle the onions generously with salt,
  pepper, and cayenne, then add the peppers.

\item Continue to cook, stirring ever so often, until the mixture is
  sauce-like, about 15 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and half the garlic.
  Continue to cook until thickened, about 10 minutes.

\item Add the remaining garlic and cook 1 to 2 minutes, or to just
  warm through.  add a few tablespoons of the pepper mixture to the
  eggs, then pour it all back into the mixture in the pan.

\item Stir over low heat until the eggs are slightly set.  Taste and
  adjust the seasoning.

\item Serve right away, sprinkled with the marjoram.
