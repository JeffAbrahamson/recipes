\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Cut the butternut squash into 1~cm cubes, dab with butter, and
    put under the broiler until soft.  (To accelerate, microwave for
    five minutes or so before broiling.)

  \item Cut the onions lengthwise, saut√© in butter with a dash of salt
    until golden.  While they are cooking, put a pot of salted water
    to boil.

  \item Add the crushed chopped garlic and cook another minute.

  \item Add the roasted butternut squash and a copious quantity of
    thyme leaves.  Cook  over low heat, covered, for another five to
    ten minutes.

  \item When the onion and squash is tender, begin cooking the pasta.

  \item Add cream to the vegetables and stir until combined.  Add
    grated parmesan and stir.  Just before taking the pasta out of the
    water, add the mozzarella and basil.

  \item Strain the pasta and add to the vegetables.  Toss and serve,
    dusted with additional parmesan.
