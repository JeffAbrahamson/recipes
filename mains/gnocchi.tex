\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Boil potatoes in water, then skin them and rice them into a
    pile while still hot.  (Don't mash: it makes a too-gooey mess.
    Using the fine grater of a food processor might work well.)

  \item Make a similar or slightly smaller pile of flour.  Mix the
    flour, potatoes, eggs, and butter together.  Mix as little as
    possible to avoid forming a gooey paste.

  \item Roll into strips 10--15~mm in diameter, cutting into 20--25~mm
    lengths.  Roll gnocchi off a fork or butter paddle to create
    indentations that permit better and quicker cooking.

  \item Cook only until gnocchi float to the surface, then lift from
    water and place in colander, then into sauce.  (Cooking longer
    apparently makes them tend to fall apart.)

  \end{enumerate}
