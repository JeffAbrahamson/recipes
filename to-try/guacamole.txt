Fresh Tableside Guacamole
by Kate Tennessen on Friday, May 6, 2011 at 10:05pm

Guacamole under the following constraints:

Preparation time no more than 5 minutes
May be prepared in serving bowl
Ingredients likely already in the refrigerator

In a bowl using a fork, smash together:

   1 perfectly ripe avocado
   2 Tablespoons finely chopped mild onion (red onions or shallots are nice)
   1 smashed clove of garlic
   the juice of ¼ lime
   1 Tbsp green Tabasco
   1 good splash Worcestershire sauce
   ½ teaspoon salt
 
Mix together, then taste.  Add more lime, Tabasco and salt to taste.
Optionally, add a little chopped tomato.  Be careful to not do any
more smashing once you've added the tomato.
