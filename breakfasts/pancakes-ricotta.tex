\begin{ingredients}
  \ingr{250}{g}{ricotta}
  \ingr{4}{\tbsp}{caster sugar}
  \ingr{3}{}{eggs, separated}
  \ingr{1}{}{orange zest}
  \ingr{28}{g}{melted butter (2~\tbsp)}
  \ingr{50}{g}{flour}
  \ingr{100}{g}{blueberries}
\end{ingredients}


\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Begin beating egg whites slowly.

  \item In a large bowl, mix the ricotta, caster sugar, and egg
    yolks. Grate the orange into the bowl and stir it in gently with
    the melted butter.

  \item Sift in the flour and carefully fold in.

  \item Beat the egg whites until stiff,then fold them lightly into
    the ricotta.  Carefully fold in the blueberries.

  \item Warm a non-stick frying pan over a moderate heat, brush with a
    little butter, then place a heaped tablespoon of mixture into the
    pan, and another two or three depending on the size of your
    pan. Cook for a minute or two till they have risen slightly and
    the underside has coloured, then, using a palette knife, flip them
    over.  Do this as if you mean it, or they will collapse as you
    turn them.  A further few minutes cooking, then serve immediately.
