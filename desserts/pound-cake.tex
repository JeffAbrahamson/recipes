  \ingr{340}{g}{butter (1\fracH\ c), at room temperature}
  \ingr{227}{g}{cream cheeze (8 oz)}

  \ingr{6}{}{large eggs, at room temperature}
\end{ingredients}


\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Preheat oven to 163\degreeC\ (325\F).  Lightly butter a 25~cm
    (10~inch) tube pan.

  \item Sift the cake flour into a small bowl and set aside.

  \item Cream the butter, cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a medium
    mixing bowl with mixer on medium-high speed until light and
    fluffy, about two minutes.

  \item Add eggs one at a time, mixing on medium after each addition
    until blended, about 10 seconds.  Mix 30 seconds more after all
    eggs are added.

  \item Stir the flour gently into the batter with a rubber spatula.
    Then mix on low speed five seconds.  Scrape the bowl and blend
    until the batter is smooth and even, five to ten seconds.

  \item Pour the batter into prepared pan.  Bake on center oven rack
    until golden and firm to the touch and a tester inserted in the
    center comes out dry, about 1 hour 35 minutes.

  \item Allow the cake to cool completely in the pan before unmolding
    and serving.
