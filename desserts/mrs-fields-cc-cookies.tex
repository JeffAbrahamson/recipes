\begin{recipe}
  This is the recipe from the GNU emacs distribution.  It is not
  actually the Mrs. Fields recipe, but it tastes very similar to their
  cookies.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Cream together butter, sugar, and brown sugar.  Add the eggs and vanilla.

  \item Process the oatmeal in a food processor or blender (in small
  amounts) until it turns to powder.  Measure 5 cups of oatmeal, not 5
  cups of powdered oatmeal.

  \item Mix together in a separate bowl the flour, the powdered
    oatmeal, as well as the salt, powder, and soda.

  \item Mix everything together.  Add chocolate chips.

  \item Make 1 inch balls and place about 2 inches apart on greased
  cookie sheets.  Bake at 350 $^\circ$F for 8--10 minutes.

  \end{enumerate}
