\begin{ingredients}
  \ingr{400}{g}{dark chocolate}
  \ingr{400}{g}{ricotta}
  \ingr{}{}{cinnamon or orange extract}
\end{ingredients}


\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Melt chocolate.  While mixing ricotta with an electric mixer
    on high, slowly pour in chocolate.  Add some cinnamon or orange
    extract if desired.

    \item Serve on bread.

  \end{enumerate}

  The goal is to avoid melting the ricotta while making this.  To that
  end, the chocolate should be as cool as possible while still being
  liquid and the cheese should be at room temperature to avoid making
  the final product too hard.

  The spread will separate as it is cooled and warmed.

\end{recipe}
