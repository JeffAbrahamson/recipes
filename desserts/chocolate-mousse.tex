\begin{ingredients}
  \ingr{5}{}{eggs}
  \ingr{1 \fracH}{tsp}{vanilla}
  \ingr{2}{Tbsp}{water (or liqueur)}
  \ingr{5}{oz}{dark chocolate}
  \ingr{2}{Tbsp}{unsalted butter}
  \ingr{\fracH}{pint}{heavy (whipping) cream}
\end{ingredients}


\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Separate eggs.  Leave whites in whipping bowl.  Put yolks
(base) in steel bowl.  Add vanilla and water.  Beat.  Heat on high;
keep moving so it doesn't scramble, util ribbon stage (waves stay).
Stir until cool.  (Add water if it starts scrambling as it cools.)

\item The above can be done more sanely over a double boiler, but it still
needs fast whipping (not simple stirring) to keep it from scrambling.

\item Melt chocolate with butter.  Stir.  Cool.  Add to base.

\item In a new bowl, whip cream.  When all is cool, beat egg whites.

\item Beat 1/4 whites into base.  Fold in remainder.  When 3/4 folded, fold
in whipped cream.  Let rest six hours.

  \end{enumerate}

Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item About one egg per person provides a nice serving size, less per
  person is probably more reasonable.

\item More butter makes it firmer for use in pastry layers.

\end{itemize}
