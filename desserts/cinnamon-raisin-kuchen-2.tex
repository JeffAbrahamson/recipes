  \ingrS{60}{ml}{warm water}
  \ingr{240}{ml}{warm milk}
  \ingr{3}{}{eggs}
  \ingr{110}{g}{sugar}

\end{ingredients}


\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Dissolve yeast in warm water with a pinch of sugar and a
    spoonful of flour.  Allow to foam, 15--30~minutes.

  \item Add milk, eggs, sugar, flour, and salt.  Knead on low to
    medium gluten development.  Add butter and knead on medium speed.

  \item Bulk ferment, about 2~hours.

  \item Roll out dough, sprinkle with butter, then cinnamon and sugar.
    Roll and cut as jelly rolls. Place in buttered pan and again sprinkle
    with butter, cinnamon, and sugar.  Proof (about 2~hours).

  \item Bake at 190\degreeC{} until brown (about 30 minutes).

  \end{enumerate}

  Note that cinnamon and sugar mixture should be at least half
  cinnamon, the remainder granulated sugar.  When sprinkling the
  mixture on buttered rolls the layer should be thick so as to make
  the dough appear dark red-brown.
