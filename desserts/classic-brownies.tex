\begin{ingredients}
  \ingr{4}{oz}{(115~g) butter}
  \ingr{4}{oz}{(115 g) unsweetened chocolate}
  \ingr{1\fracQ}{c}{(250~g) sugar}
  \ingr{1}{tsp}{vanilla extract}
  \ingr{\fracQ}{tsp}{salt}
  \ingr{2}{}{eggs}
  \ingr{\fracH}{c}{flour}
\end{ingredients}


\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Preheat oven to 400\F\ (205\degreeC).  Butter an 8-inch square pan.

  \item In a large bowl melt butter and chocolate together.

  \item Stir sugar, vanilla, and salt into chocolate mixture.  Stir in
    eggs one at a time.  Then stir in flour.  Continue stirring until
    very smooth, until mixture pulls away from sides of bowl.

  \item Scrape batter into prepared pan and bake 20 minutes.

  \end{enumerate}

  Notes: Beat with an electric mixer, but do not whip, the
  ingredients.  Something about the added density gives the brownies a
  more intense chocolate flavor and a better crust.  The original
  recipe calls for chilling the brownies in a cold water bath
  immediately on exit from the oven.
