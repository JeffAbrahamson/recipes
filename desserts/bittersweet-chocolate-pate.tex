    double boiler and cook over simmering water, stirring frequently,
    until chocolate melts.  Remove from heat and whip.

  \item Pour into an $8\times 4$ inch loaf pan (or two $5\times
    2$\fracH inch small loaf pans lined with parchment or wax paper.
    Refrigerate overnight.

  \item Before serving, unmold and slice with a sharp knife dipped in

  \item Puree berries and sugar in blender until smooth.  Serve with p\^at\'e.

Blueberries apparently have enough pectin that the berry mixture will
begin to gel.  This isn't bad, but suggests pouring the berry mixture
on the chocolate an hour or so before serving.
