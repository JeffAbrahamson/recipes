  \ingr{1.5}{c}{sugar}
\end{ingredients}


\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Soak beans overnight.
    
  \item Put in a pot with 4--5 cups water, let boil for 5~minutes, then discard water.
    
  \item In a clean pot, place red beans and 4-5 cups of water, cover,
    and let it simmer at low heat for 1 1/2 to 2 hours (add more water
    to keep above the beans). The beans should now be very soft,
    easily crushed between fingers.
    
  \item Discard water again, put soft beans back in the pot with sugar
    at medium high heat and constantly stir and mix about 10 minutes
    until forming a paste that looks shiny but still
    loose. Immediately transfer the paste to a container.

  \end{enumerate}
