\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Remove the stalks from the tomatoes.  Optionally, remove the
    skin.  Cut the tomatoes radially in quarters (or more, depending
    on the size of the tomatoes).  Remove the seeds and juice, leaving
    as much of the flesh as possible.

  \item Place in an oven-proof pan.  Season to taste.  Drizzle with a
    bit of olive oil.  Bake at 85\C{} for 60--90~minutes until dry.
