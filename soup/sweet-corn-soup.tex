If using frozen corn, make sure to use stock.  Fresh corn can use water.

\begin{ingredients}
  \ingr{1}{Tbsp}{butter or corn oil}
  \ingr{1}{}{small onion, thinly sliced}
  \ingr{\fracH}{c}{grated waxy potato, such as Yellow Fin}
  \ingr{6}{ears}{corn (about 4 cups)}
  \ingr{7}{c}{water or stock, plus 1 c water}
  \ingr{1}{tsp}{salt}
  \ingr{}{}{cream or milk, optional}
  \ingr{}{}{chopped parley, basil, lovage, tarragon, chives, or dill}
\end{ingredients}


\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Shuck the corn, remove the silk, the slice off the kernels.

  \item In a wide soup pot, melt the butter, then add the onion,
    potato, and 1 cup of the water.  Cover the pot and stew over
    medium heat until the onion is soft, about 10 minutes.

  \item Add the corn, salt, and the remaining water and bring to a
    boil.  Lower the heat and simmer, partially covered, for 10
    minutes.

  \item Cool briefly, then puree in a blender in two batches, allowing
    3 minutes for each batch.  Pass through a food mill or fine
    strainer, then return the soup to the stove and stir in a little
    cream to thin it if desired.  Taste for salt and serve sprinkled
    with herbs.

  \end{enumerate}

  When reheating, stir frequently and don't boil or the soup will curdle.
