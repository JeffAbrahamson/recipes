Recipes and LaTeX


To use these recipes, you probably want to git clone and type make.


This is my collection of recipes.  I hold copyright for the recipes
only if I have so indicated via the bibliographic entries (\source).
Where I have the right to stipulate your usage of this content, you
are welcome to use it under the terms of the Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.

That is, in particular, true of the LaTeX itself.  Alternately, you
may consider the LaTeX and other construction code as being GPL 3.0
(or later, at your discretion).

Other recipes may be subject to other copyright and licensing terms.
I present them here to share them with people I know and with the
expectation that, in plain view of the world, they are nonetheless
nearly invisible in their obscurity and so not a threat to the
copyright holder.  If you hold copyright for a recipe here and you
object to its appearance in this collection, please file an issue
using github.  Assign me to the issue, and I will remove the file for
you.  In the issue, please explain in simple and polite language why
you believe you hold copyright.  If you are belligerent and
obfuscating, I will probably ask a lot of questions, which will waste
time.  If you contact me in any other way, your correspondence will
become part of the repository and I will create an issue for you.
That last is a threat, not an offer...
