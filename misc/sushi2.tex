\begin{ingredients}
  \ingr{1}{c}{rice}
  \ingrS{1}{c}{water}
  \ingrS{\fracQ}{c}{rice vinegar}
  \ingr{2}{\tsp}{sugar}
  \ingr{1\fracH}{\tsp}{salt}
\end{ingredients}


\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Rinse rice until water is clear.  Let rice soak in clear water for 30 minutes.
    
  \item Drain rice.  Put in rice cooker with water.  Note that this
    makes slightly firmer rice, since we'll add vinegar at the end.

  \item Mix vinegar, sugar, and salt.  Gently heat to dissolve.
    
  \item When the rice is cooked, moisten a sushi oke/hangiri or a
    large bowl so that the rice won't stick.  Transfer rice into the
    sushi oke, spread so it will cool faster.  Pour vinegar over rice
    while still warm.  Mix with a rice paddle and a slicing motion at
    45~degrees.  Continue until rice is cool.  Store covered with a
    damp towel until ready to use.

  \end{enumerate}
