\begin{ingredients}
  \ingr{540}{ml}{rice (3 180 mg cups = 492 g)}
  \ingr{}{}{water}
  \ingr{540}{ml}{water}
  \ingr{5}{cm}{dashi kombu}
  \ingrS{80}{ml}{rice vinegar}
  \ingr{3}{\tbsp}{sugar}
  \ingr{1\fracH}{tsp}{kosher salt (use half if fine sale)}
\end{ingredients}


\begin{recipe}
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Rinse rice until water is clear.  Let rice soak in clear water for 30 minutes.
    
  \item Drain rice.  Put in rice cooker and add 540~ml water.  Place
    the dashi kombu on top and let cook.  Note that this makes
    slightly firmer rice, since we'll add vinegar at the end.

  \item Mix vinegar, sugar, and salt.  Gently heat to dissolve.
    
  \item When the rice is cooked, moisten a sushi oke/hangiri or a
    large bowl so that the rice won't stick.  Transfer rice into the
    sushi oke, spread so it will cool faster.  Pour vinegar over rice
    while still warm.  Mix with a rice paddle and a slicing motion at
    45~degrees.  Continue until rice is cool.  Store covered with a
    damp towel until ready to use.
