  \begin{enumerate}

  \item In a large saut\'e pan or skillet, cook the onions, garlic,
    salt, and wine over medium heat until the onions just start to
    soften, about 5 minutes.

  \item Add the thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, oregano, pepper, nutmeg,
    and vegetable stock.  Cover and cook until the liquid evaporates
    and the onion and garlic are very soft and light brown, about 20
    mintues.

  \item Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature.

  \item Crumble the tofu into a medium bowl.  Add the miso and the
    onion mixture and blend well.  In a food processor, process this
    mixture, in batches if necessary, until smooth.

  \item Serve at room temperature or chilled.
