\begin{recipe}

This crust is best for savory fillings.  Use p\^ate sucr\'ee for sweet pies.

The dough can be stored refrigerated for a week or more before baking.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Work butter very lightly into flour and salt.  This can be
  done best by working the flour and butter first with the fingers and
  then lightly and quickly rotating it between the palms of the
  hands.

\item Make a well in the flour mixture and gradually pour in the
  water.  Use the index finger to stir the liquid quickly into the
  flour in a spiral fashion, beginning at the inside of the well and
  gradually moving to the outer edge.  The dough should be soft enough
  to gather up into a ball but should not stick to the fingers or the
  board.

\item Allow the dough to rest refrigerated from 2 to 36 hours.  Cover
  it with a damp, wrung-out cloth for the shorter period or a piece of
  foil for the longer one.  The resting of the dough breaks any
  rubbery reactions it might develop when rolled and handled.

\item Roll or press into a pie crust.  Bake with filling according to need.

  \end{enumerate}
