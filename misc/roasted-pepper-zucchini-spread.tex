  It may be that the flavor improves by the next day.  Initially the
  flavor sequence is a bit strange, with sweetness (apple) followed by
  saltiness (tomato) followed by garlic.

  I roasted one of the zucchinis in order to reduce moisture.  It's
  not clear that this was worth the bother.

  I added three or four prunes as sweetener.  I don't think this was
  worthwhile, although it didn't hurt.

  The olive oil probably could be omitted without ill effect.
