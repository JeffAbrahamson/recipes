  \item In a small saucepan, gradually melt the butter and bring it to
    bubbling.  When the top is covered with foam, add the other
    ingredients and reduce the heat to a simmer.  Gently simmer,
    uncovered, on low heat.

  \item After about 45 to 60 minutes, when the surface becomes
    transparent and the milk solids are on the bottom, pour the liquid
    through a cheesecloth into a heat-resistant container.  Discard
    the spices and solids.

    for up to two months.
